It’s not hard to understand why. Rarely available, with a huge wrap-around/side and rear garden for passionate gardeners, or for children to burn off energy throughout the day, this property harks back to an era when homes were built with grandeur. Endowed with generous proportions, high ceilings and late Georgian/early Victorian styling and craftsmanship, the property features a curved staircase and multiple, elegant period features. The 1840’s has always been my favourite era of house building and this property is a dream home for me. It just works on so many levels. Each window is a picture onto the mature garden or the horse-chestnuts of the nearby park, unoverlooked from so many aspects, it truly feels like ‘a country house in the city’. A grand entrance hallway with high ceilings and ornate cornicing leads to a bright and airy double reception room with retained original features: the fabulous large sash windows of the period with sliding shutters integrated within the side walls, wide plank wood flooring and fire settings, and a beautiful curved wall. A spacious study with dual aspect is set on the same floor. The lower ground floor features the heart of the property with large, Bulthaup fitted kitchen with central island and with sliding glass doors giving direct access to the rear patio and garden. The dining room with wood burner, is spacious, welcoming and with good ceiling height. The parquet wood flooring glows with the light streaming from the large south facing window to the front. The lower-level hallway offers a most useful boot room, guest cloakroom and large utility room. There is a side garden door for quick access to the garden or parking area. The first-floor landing is a picture itself with attractive turning staircase and a tall (2.8m) west facing side window through which the afternoon sun pours. The principal bedroom is set to the rear with en-suite bathroom. A further two double bedrooms and family bathroom suite are set over the first-floor level. The second floor offers a fabulous double bedroom suite with dressing area and walk-in wet room and a huge eaves storage space. The garden is divine. Three lovely white and blue wisteria adorn the house, providing a spectacular display in summer. With aspects to the south and west the beds are well stocked with mature plants, shrubs and flowering trees for year-round interest, surrounding an unusually huge expanse of lawned garden. This wonderful space is rare in the centre of London as is the generous private off-street parking via secure gates to the side of the house. Northampton Park is a wide and quiet side road next to St Paul’s Shrubbery and close to Canonbury station. Upper Street is a most enjoyable walk away, taking in the Alwyne’s and Canonbury Square, whilst Newington Green is the new go-to for food lovers with many trendy new eateries.

SE1 0QX More properties from this agent",[],"This fine, early Victorian semi-detached house lies on Northampton Park in Islington, on the edge of Canonbury and close to both Highbury and Newington Green. Grade II-listed and set in the Canonbury Conservation Area, the five-bedroom home was built in 1845 and is set across over 3,100 sq ft of internal accommodation. The house is somewhat unique for the area: it occupies an exceptionally spacious and wide-set plot, with wonderfully mature gardens and additional space for secure car parking. Internal architectural features have been beautifully preserved and include original plasterwork, pitch pine floorboards and marble chimneypieces. Mercifully unaltered, the original Victorian proportions and plan lend themselves brilliantly to contemporary life.
 
 Setting the Scene
 
 Northampton Park is set at the northern edge of land originally granted to the Canons of St Bartholomew's Priory, Smithfield, in 1253, later to become known as Canonbury. The land and surrounding area were later acquired in the 18th century and developed in the early 19th century by the Marquess of Northampton, hence the road’s name. The Northampton family owned swathes of Clerkenwell, Finsbury and Islington and were responsible for much of the residential development of these areas, the building works moving northward as the 19th century unfolded.
 
 This home is set in a covetable position at the northern end of the peaceful Northampton Park, a particularly wide set sweeping road that connects to both St Paul’s Road to the south and St Paul’s Place to the east, with St Paul’s Shrubbery, a quiet, wooded park, forming the centre of a triangle of the three connecting roads.
 
 The Grand Tour
 
 Set back from Northampton Park behind spearhead railings and a charming English country-style garden with a star magnolia tree, this south-facing house is three storeys high and three bays wide, built from London stock brick with the west range slightly recessed and containing the raised ground floor entrance.
 
 A Yorkstone path leads to the porch, formed of an engaged Doric antae, plain entablature, decorative transom light and the original panelled door. Fenestration comprises six-over-six box sashes, and the house is crowned with a hipped, slated roof, punctuated by dormer windows to the rear. To the side of the house from the road, large wooden gates open to the private enclosed parking area, with the expansive private gardens unfolding from here.
 
 Entrance is to the raised ground-floor hallway, where tall ceilings meet original plaster cornicing. The open-well staircase lies directly ahead, gently curving its way spine-like through to the top of the house. A study lies to the rear of the staircase, and the remainder of the raised ground floor is home to the capacious bipartite drawing room, over 30 ft deep, with shuttered windows framing views at both north and south aspects and flooding the rooms with light. Carrara marble chimneypieces feature in each of the spaces, separated by folding wedding doors.
 
 Pitch pine parquet flooring extends underfoot through the entire lower ground-floor plan, with a Bulthaup kitchen, dining and informal sitting room, utility room, WC and boot room. A service hall is set to the side of this floor, with an exterior door; further sliding glass doors open directly from the kitchen to an outdoor paved terrace, the perfect spot for long lunches in the warmer months.
 
 The first floor has three bedrooms, including the principal bedroom with its own en suite bathroom and wonderful views to the rear garden, while the two bedrooms to the front of the plan share a bathroom. The uppermost storey has two further bedrooms: one is currently used as a generous dressing room, and both share a wet room finished in a contemporary manner. There is also a vast attic space on this top storey, set within the eaves; incredibly useful for additional storage.
 
 The Great Outdoors
 
 The gardens that envelop the house are exceptionally unusual, almost double the width of the house itself and equally deep. Three mature wisterias wind their way around the entire rear and side elevations of the house - a remarkable feature in spring, when they erupt with blossom. There are multiple spots for seating, including a charming paved terrace nearest the kitchen.
 
 The spacious lawn is surrounded by mature trees and shrubs, with fragrant roses, deep flower beds and a huge evergreen magnolia grandiflora on the central axis of the garden with the delightful pergola, which is positioned carefully to take advantage of the late afternoon sun. A beautiful magnolia denudata is in the west corner.
 
 To the south of the plot is the walled part of the garden, currently used as a gated and enclosed parking space, with a tall sycamore maple tree towering to one side and a parrotia persica affords further privacy and a stunning autumn flush. Documentary evidence suggests there was a coach house here at one time, which could provide evidence for structural development again, subject to local planning consent.
 
 Out and About
 
 Northampton Park is in an excellent location, close to Newington Green’s thriving culinary scene and a great selection of parks, including Highbury Fields, Clissold Park and directly from the south end of Northampton Park, the most beautiful stroll and a short cut to the best tranche of Upper street is down the New River Walk, a restored 1613 aqueduct that is now a peaceful single track walkway that meanders through Canonbury to Cross Street along the waterway.
 
 Dalston and Islington’s Upper Street are also close by, the latter home to an abundance of amenities, from Gail’s and Ottolenghi to The Almeida Theatre and The Old Red Lion Theatre and Pub. King’s Cross and Coal Drops Yard are also within walking distance.
 
 Head west and Highbury’s butchers, delis and cafés form a wonderful Sunday morning itinerary, as do the village-like shops and markets along Stoke Newington’s Church Street. Highbury Barn is also just north, with its highly regarded butcher, deli and cheese shop.
 
 The closest local purveyors however are at Newington Green, including Belle Epoque patisserie, further bakeries, a greengrocer, an Italian deli, a florist, Stella's butchers, a health food shop and Oneo, a fishmonger/sushi bar and wine shop, as well as numerous restaurants including Cadet, Primeur, Jolene, Westerns Laundry, Farang and Perilla.
 
 The Estorick Collection, a brilliant Islington gallery focusing on Italian art, is a short stroll away south and runs a year-round programme of exhibitions; it also has a charming Italian café. Nearby Highbury Fields contains tennis courts, a playground, a swimming pool and a gym within Highbury Leisure Centre.
 
 There are plenty of excellent primary schools nearby, including Canonbury Primary School and St. Paul’s Steiner School, while St Paul’s Cathedral School is a short bus ride away in the City, as is Dallington School in Clerkenwell, while North Bridge House School has a site in Canonbury itself. Some of London’s best independent secondary schools are also easily accessible and include the City of London School and the City of London School for Girls. Alternative day schools can be easily accessed via the Mildmay Line, including South Hampstead High School and University College School.
 
 Highbury and Islington station (Victoria line and Overground) as well as Canonbury station (Overground) both provide brilliant connections into central London and the north-west to south-east London axis. There are also plenty of bus routes.

The result is a home of extraordinary elegance, where Victorian heritage meets modern craftsmanship in a seamless and truly unique way. The house spans nearly 3,000 sq ft across five floors, offering five beautifully appointed bedrooms and four luxurious bathrooms. At the heart of the home lies a stylish and sophisticated handmade kitchen by Matthew King Design. Thoughtfully laid out and finished with Costa Esmerelda green quartzite countertops, the kitchen is equipped with a Lacanche range, a breakfast bar, a Fisher & Paykel fridge freezer with ice maker, a discreet wine fridge, a breakfast pantry cupboard, and a Quooker tap with boiling, sparkling and chilled filtered water. The adjoining dining space retains all of its original Victorian detailing and looks onto the mature trees of Colebrooke Row Gardens. The reception spaces are arranged across three floors. On the first floor is a large, double aspect reception room which is flooded with natural light, oozing character and comfort. The floor-to-ceiling windows again look onto the beautiful Colebrooke Row Gardens. The rear of the room has been recently fitted out as a library and snug. On the lower ground floor is a generously proportioned cinema room / further sitting room. On the half landing, a delightful study boasts charming views of the rear garden from its floor-to-ceiling window. The principal suite occupies the entire second floor and features a large bedroom, extensive and cleverly designed storage, and an unusually spacious en-suite principal bathroom finished in Brazilian green marble, complete with Lefroy Brooks shower and fittings, a Thomas Crapper traditional high cistern WC, and a large solid brass bateau bath. The home boasts four Carrera marble fireplaces. The house retains its original Victorian detailing, including unusually ornate and fully professionally restored cornicing and ceiling roses. The recent renovation included new solid oak flooring throughout the house; a mid-oak premium parquet herringbone on the principal three floors and cross-sawn and smoked natural oak on the top and lower ground elevations.  All aspects of the build are to the very highest standards. All four bathrooms have underfloor heating, the whole house and garden pod are ethernet wired (CAT6e) for hyperfast internet access on every floor, and there is a full suite of Banham security and CCTV systems. The property has a dedicated boot room at ground floor level complete with W.C. and a utility room on the lower ground floor.  The recently landscaped rear garden, by Emma Griffin Garden Design, was designed as a multi-zoned courtyard garden featuring a sunken dining area under a pergola, a higher seating area with a bespoke water feature, integrated lighting and irrigation systems, power sockets for garden working, and cleverly concealed storage areas. At the rear of the garden, sits a garden pod designed and built by Podspace, designed to be used year-round as a studio or office complete with high speed ethernet, insulation and upgraded underfloor heating. The private roof terrace, accessed via a custom-made retractable glass door, is a further space for entertaining or secluded relaxation. Also designed by Emma Griffin Garden Design, it has panoramic views, a bespoke lighting scheme, complete irrigation system, power sockets, and an automatic rain sensor on the glass door. Furthermore, the house offers extensive additional storage via large, under-pavement vaults. A complete re-roofing of the house during renovation allowed for increased ceiling heights on the top floor, which now accommodates three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The house is situated within the Colebrooke Row and Duncan Terrace conservation area. It benefits from a unique position, quiet due to Duncan Terrace being set back from Colebrook Row and having virtually no traffic due to Islington's low-traffic neighbourhoods and yet a couple of moments from the amenities of Camden Passage and Angel and with close proximity from Upper Street. Duncan Terrace is a very short distance from Angel Station, and King's Cross station is one stop away on the Northern Line. Camden Passage Market is very close by, with a selection of popular cafes and restaurants. The shopping facilities and restaurants in Angel generally are well-known and wide ranging. Duncan Terrace is ideal for those seeking easy accessibility into the City. The Regents Canal Path is virtually opposite the house, offering beautiful trips. Even closer to the property, Duncan Terrace Gardens and Colebrook Row Gardens mean there is quiet space to relax amongst mature trees and beautiful planting adjacent to the front door.

 More properties from this agent",[],"Quietly removed from the coveted northern section of Islington’s Upper Street, just west of Canonbury Square, lies this rare duo of Victorian buildings united as one enormous house and garden. With commercial space across its ground and lower ground levels, there is more than 5,500 sq ft of internal space overall. It occupies a wonderful corner site on the peaceful intersection of Canonbury Lane and Tyndale Terrace. Much of the house benefits from the light of three aspects and excellent, elevated views of London from a sweeping fourth-floor extension designed by Studio 54 Architecture.
 
 The Tour
 
 The residential part of the house is entered on Tynedale Terrace through a pair of antique French front doors surrounded by Wisteria and Clematis. This opens to a welcoming hall with high ceilings, timber flooring, and a floor-to-ceiling sash window looking out onto the stepped garden.
 
 A staircase, one of two through the house, leads up from the south-east corner to the first floor. First, to a double reception arranged in an L-shape and filled with light from windows on three sides. On the opposite side of the plan, in a similar layout, lies the kitchen and dining room with a window looking onto the garden and beyond to Union Chapel. From the landing of the second staircase are steel steps that lead down to the garden.
 
 There are two bedrooms on each of the second and third floors, one en suite and two further bathrooms between the remainder. The fourth floor was designed by Charles Thompson of Studio 54 Architects as a studio workspace in a sweeping open plan that covers both buildings with a wall of glazing across the southern aspect and a stainless steel kitchenette opposite. A wide terrace sits behind a lowered south-facing parapet and overlooks the city of London and beyond. The window wall and roof are raked to follow the sightlines from Canonbury Square and create a bold asymmetrical dimension to the simple rectangular plan.
 
 The commercial space is offered with vacant possession. It is currently occupied on an informal basis by a charming local produce shop but could be used as a live/work studio, office or gallery space. Once the headquarters of renowned furniture brand Coexistence, it forms an L-shape on the ground floor with a glazed double shop front and steps down to the commercial basement, which comprises two large open-plan spaces, a WC and access to the garden at the rear.
 
 Outside Space
 
 The stepped, walled garden can be accessed from the commercial space, the entrance hall to the residential section, and from the first floor via a set of steel steps with one curved side, designed by the architect Charles Thompson.
 
 The Area
 
 Canonbury Lane is just minutes from the boutiques, cafes and eateries of Upper Street, which is home to an abundance of amenities, from Ottolenghi to Gail’s, the Almeida Theatre to The Old Red Lion Theatre & Pub. The charming Compton Arms and the wonderful Union Chapel are both a minute’s walk from the house.
 
 Islington High Street and the excellent Camden Passage are also close by. The area has some very good gastropubs, including The Drapers Arms and The Albion. Corbin and King’s Bellanger is nearby on Islington Green.
 
 The much-admired shops and restaurants of Highbury Barn are just to the north, through the green open space of Highbury Fields – which has tennis courts, a playground and a swimming pool. King’s Cross and Coal Drops Yard are also within easy reach.
 
 The area enjoys excellent access to public transport, including several main bus routes to the City and central London. The Victoria Line at Highbury & Islington is a few minutes’ walk from the house, and the Northern Line is available at Angel.

 Set on the corner of De Beauvoir's picturesque garden square, this 1840s Grade II-listed Neo-Jacobean house has been reimagined by interior architect and curator Irenie Studio into a richly layered, life-enhancing home. Known as OntheSq, the house is both a residence and an immersive backdrop for contemporary design, storytelling, and collaboration. 
 
 The four-storey home has been sensitively restored and extended, blending historical character with playful, contemporary interventions. The original oriel windows and curving staircase remain, while new elements - like a lantern-roofed kitchen and bespoke colour palette - bring a fresh narrative to the space. 
 
 Throughout, the interiors are imbued with a sense of wonder. Inspired by Alice in Wonderland, Irenie has introduced moments of visual surprise: a dining table crafted from salvaged doors by Rio Kobayashi, woven textiles by Tomoyo Tsurumi incorporating remnants of the home's past, and custom glassware by J. Hill's Standard, echoing bottles unearthed during renovation. 
 
 The lower ground floor hosts the kitchen, where an over-head lantern overlooks maple cabinetry and reclaimed Iroko countertops. This space opens onto a terraced garden by award-winning garden designer Peter Beardsley. A welcoming oak-framed bench and seating area offers a chance to unwind in the morning sunshine, while steps lead up to a decorative garden with raised beds and a barbecue area. A reclaimed emerald green door from the original house has been salvaged and now sits as a moment of intrigue at the end of the garden, aptly named the cupboard of curiosity.
 
 Upstairs, three bedrooms and three reception rooms - one doubling as a snug or fourth bedroom - offer flexible living. The stairwell is painted in Rosa Red, a custom shade developed with Fenwick & Tilbrook, referencing the roses of De Beauvoir Square.
 
 Every detail has been considered, from the diamond-patterned tiled floors that mirror the leaded windows, to the curated selection of furniture and art by designers including Bethan Laura Wood, Peter Pilotto, and Flavia Brändle. The result is a home that feels both rooted in history and alive with contemporary creativity.
 
 No. 9 De Beauvoir Square is a unique opportunity to own a home that is both a personal sanctuary and a celebration of design. 
 
 De Beauvoir N1 is a vibrant enclave known for its unique blend of creative energy and village-like charm. The area is home to an array of independent boutiques, artisanal coffee shops, and eateries. Along the leafy streets, you'll find local gems such as De Beauvoir Deli, offering gourmet provisions, and Hector's, a stylish wine bar perfect for an evening with friends.
 
 For dining, Duke's Brew & Que and Sweet Thursday serve up everything from slow-cooked meats to wood-fired pizzas, while The De Beauvoir Arms provides a relaxed setting for a Sunday roast. Wellness enthusiasts will appreciate the range of yoga studios, health clubs, and green spaces, including the nearby Regent's Canal, ideal for a morning jog or a leisurely walk.
 
 Just a short stroll away, the cultural and culinary delights of Upper Street in Islington offer endless options from theatres and galleries to buzzy restaurants and bars. With excellent transport links, De Beauvoir strikes the balance between a peaceful, community feel and proximity to central London.

SE1 0QX More properties from this agent",[],"This elegant early Victorian townhouse lies in a quiet and coveted spot within Islington’s Barnsbury Conservation Area. Beautifully designed and recently renovated to an exceptionally high standard by Emmett Russell Architects, the house is set over almost 2,000 sq ft across four light-filled storeys and has a thoughtfully conceived private walled garden. The restoration encompasses an exhaustive renewal of all structural and design elements, including wonderful bespoke cabinetry, exquisite decorative finishes and newer architectural elements including a handsome custom-built kitchen and chic bathrooms, all carefully chosen to complement the home’s architectural provenance. Setting the Scene Lambert Street is positioned in the northernmost part of Barnsbury’s eponymous conservation area, equidistant from both Upper Street and Caledonian Road, and surrounded by countless public green spaces in the adjoining streets, including Barnard Park, and Thornhill and Barnsbury squares. Lambert street is a quiet, one-way street with limited car traffic and even fewer pedestrians. The land was originally nurseries prior to development, which began in the earlier half of the 19th century. The surrounding streets are all formed of fine late Georgian and early Victorian houses, with the homes on Lambert Street built between 1839-41, just after Queen Victoria ascended the throne. Houses such as these were built for the emerging middle classes during a period of unprecedented residential construction in what was then considered suburban London. The Grand Tour Set on the tree-lined easterly side of the street, the west-facing house is one of a pair of semi-detached villas behind spearhead railings with a gate inset. Built from London stock brick, the house is three bays wide, incorporating a double-height porch to one side. Fenestration is comprised of newly installed double-glazed two-over-two box sash windows set in original housings. There is a Yorkstone path with space to the side for bicycle parking and steps lead up to the raised ground entrance porch, with the panelled door framed by fluted pilaster jambs. The four-panel door has a transom light set above, and door furniture is comprised of Banham security locks and a doctor’s knocker, both in a polished brass finish; further security systems in place include cameras to the front and rear of the house, and an integrated alarm system. Entry is to the light and wide-set entrance hall, where fumed oak floorboards extend underfoot and walls feature wainscotting. As part of the extensive renovations recently undertaken, all services were renewed, with cast-iron radiators installed in the upper storeys and a total rewire (including Cat 6 cabling) and replumb – with a water softening system integrated – conducted. The home’s decorative elements, including bespoke joinery and new plasterwork cornicing in historical designs, are all offset with a series of beautiful colours from  Little Greene Paint Company . To the left of the hall is the bipartite drawing room, with a wide architrave connecting both front and rear spaces; large windows at both aspects flood the space with light. The front area has a striking marble chimney piece, inset with a gas fire and surrounded by bookcases fitted in the alcoves. The rear space is currently used as a study-cum-library, with views through the shuttered roundhead window to the raised rear garden and mature magnolia tree. A contemporary staircase leads from the rear of the hallway to the lower-ground floor, and the focus of much of the recent structural reimagining of the home. Comprised of the dining room, kitchen, informal sitting room, utility room and a shower room, the floor was lowered to create a very generous ceiling height throughout, with underfloor heating installed in all spaces. The dining area has a particularly excellent ceiling height and was entirely rebuilt as part of the works with a handsome seamed copper roof inset with an expansive roof light. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors slide open to the garden terrace outside and raised garden above. The kitchen is positioned in the centre of the lower-ground plan, with pocket doors that can be utilised to enclose it from seating areas, if required. Bespoke cabinetry in a panelled design is complemented by brass ironmongery by Armac Martin and pale Silestone rests above, with a double bullnose edge. The central island unit houses a Villeroy and Boch double butler sink with a Perrin and Rowe brass mixer tap with instant boiling water and Insinkerator, while fitted and integrated appliances include double Bosch ovens and a Neff induction hob, an integrated Miele dishwasher and a freestanding Samsung double stainless steel fridge/freezer is inset within the cabinetry. A built-in illuminated and mirrored cocktail cabinet also features in the kitchen, while  Lewis and Wood’s ‘Windrush’  wallpaper lines the rear wall and lends character to the space. The cosy sitting room is set to the front of the plan, leading to the utility and shower rooms. The utility room has been thoughtfully designed with the same cabinetry as the kitchen, with Diespeker terrazzo tiles and space for both a washer and a dryer. The shower room opposite also doubles as a guest WC, with the floor and wall lined with marble designs by  Mandarin Stone . The remaining exposed walls are micro-cement in a bespoke colour, a material chosen for its durability and waterproof nature. Brassware is chrome-plated in a traditional design by Perrin and Rowe. The principal bedroom suite lies on the first storey. Currently encompassing the entire level with a bedroom, adjoining dressing room and separate bathroom, the floor could be reconfigured as two separate bedrooms if desired. Sleeping quarters are set to the front of the plan, opening through wedding doors to the dressing room, with a wall of bespoke wardrobing with rattan panels. The wooden bed frame and headboard were custom-built to match the wardrobing and are to remain, if required. The bathroom is set in what is a recent addition directly above the hallway, thoughtfully designed with exquisite materials and elements including further patterned marbles from Mandarin Stone and Fired Earth, a spacious shower enclosure and separate Japanese-style soaking bath. Brassware is in an art deco design by Perrin and Rowe and a large antique sideboard acts as a vanity for two under-mounted sinks with Carrara marble atop. A skylight inset into the ceiling allows further natural light into the space, in addition to the window beside the bath, and underfloor heating warms the floor tiles. On the uppermost storey is a further bedroom, reached by a contemporary staircase with oak open treads. A sleeping platform has been thoughtfully constructed, with further butt-and-bead panelled storage set in the eaves. Two conservation grade roof lights are set into the pitch, allowing for framed views of the nighttime sky. Although currently configured as a two-bedroom home, further plans have been designed by Emmett Russell Architects to reconfigure the existing plan to create additional sleeping quarters as either a three or four-bedroom home, subject to local planning consent. The Great Outdoors The private walled garden opens immediately from the dining area at lower ground level, through the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors, allowing for a seamless continuation of the interior living space, and was conceived and programmed by award-winning garden designer Adolfo Harrison. Entirely redesigned and rebuilt as part of the recent main works to the house, the walls have been newly built from reclaimed London stock brick in a double pile formation, making them exceptionally stable and allowing for a private and un-overlooked exterior space. Reclaimed Yorkstone has been used as a primary material for the terrace at lower ground level, and for the steps that ascend to the upper seating terrace, with the lower terrace also housing a barbecue area fitted with a gas supply. Flower beds are set in the series of ascending terraces, and jasmine winds its way around the balustrade and boundary walls. A wonderfully mature magnolia tree features in the uppermost north corner of the garden and is a principal feature of the planting design. It blooms from June through to September. There are also Japanese maples, climbing hydrangeas, fuchsias, rosemary, irises and further hydrangeas. A fitted bench runs along the rear east wall set on reclaimed stone corbels, allowing for fitted seating for a dining table, if required. A Victorian cast iron garden lamp acts as a feature element within the garden lighting programme. Out and About Lambert Street is a peaceful tree-lined street in the largest conservation area in Islington, defined by its late-Georgian and early Victorian terraces. There are several weekend food markets within walking distance for fresh independent produce and excellent health food shops on Caledonian Road. The house is also close to  SUNDAY , a neighbourhood favourite for brunch and coffee and Southpaw Coffee. Two of the best pubs in the area for food and wine, The Drapers Arms and The Albion, are within walking distance from the house, as is  The Tamil Prince , described by restaurant critic Grace Dent as “a sharp, bold reworking of the desi pub concept into the here and now”. Upper Street is a five-minute walk away and offers a wealth of retail, culinary, cultural and design amenities, including Ottolenghi, Gail’s, Le Labo, Aria and twentytwentyone, as well as a host of national and independent retailers and restaurants, including The Wolseley group’s  Bellanger  on Islington Green, The Compton Arms and the Pig and Butcher. King’s Cross and Coal Drops Yard are a short walk along the canal; the recently redeveloped space is home to a magnificent public square with choreographed fountains and restaurants, including Caravan, Vinoteca, Dishoom, Granger and Co, plus shops A.P.C, COS, Margaret Howell and Wolf and Badger. Green space is provided by nearby Thornhill Square, Barnsbury Square, Barnard Park. Highbury Fields is also in proximity with its tennis courts, playground and swimming pool. There are excellent schools and nurseries within the area, including St Andrew’s Montessori Nursery, William Tyndale Primary School and, slightly further afield, the independent Dallington School in Clerkenwell, St Paul’s Cathedral School in The City and North Bridge House School in Canonbury. City of London School and the City of London School for Girls are also within easy reach. The closest transport links are from Caledonian Road and Barnsbury Overground, which runs direct lines to Hackney in one direction and Richmond in the other. The Underground and rail network are also within easy walking distance at Highbury and Islington station (Victoria line) and Angel (Northern line). King’s Cross/St Pancras International station is reachable on foot in just 20 minutes, or one stop away on the Victoria line for the Eurostar. Council Tax Band: G

SE1 0QX More properties from this agent",[],"Handsome, dignified and generous, this remarkable Grade II-listed Victorian house in Islington unfolds across three floors. It upholds an exquisite period integrity with its bookending sash windows, ornate cornicing and broad cast-iron fireplaces. From the kitchen, steps ascend to a beautiful paved garden where pink rosebushes sit alongside evergreen plants. Upper Street is minutes away on foot and is home to some of London’s best-loved culinary and cultural institutions. Setting the Scene St Peter’s Street was named after the now demolished St Peter’s Church. The church was built on land given by esteemed British architectect Thomas Cubitt, known for his planning in Pimlico, Belgravia and Bloomsbury. Formerly known as River Lane, the street had, by 1841, been renamed and extended from Frog Lane. In the decade that ensued, both sides of St Peter’s Street were filled with tall townhouses – many of which remain today. The smart terrace of five Grade II-listed houses that this home sits within were built in 1848. They stand unique from the other Victorian houses that line St Peter’s Street, with their partly stepped-back silhouettes. Of particular note are the street-facing sash windows, which have unusual margin lights, and the uniquely ornate wrought-iron railings that stand between the house and the street. The Grand Tour Entry to the house is via a green-painted studded front door, slightly recessed and set beneath a wide architrave. The door opens to a central hallway grounded with the original pine flooring. Refined patterned cornicing and a ceiling rose greet on arrival and are repeated in almost every room. As is typical for 19th-century domestic architecture, a double reception room – interlinked by a wide, open archway – extends on the right-hand side. Atypical, however, are its sweeping proportions and beautiful retained cornice. The spaces have a brilliant flexibility and are presently configured as a sitting room and a study. There are sash windows at either end, both with original white-painted shutters. The window at the rear is particularly striking, with its elegant curvature that allows for immersive garden views. Both rooms have cast-iron fireplaces set within marble surrounds and generous banks of bespoke shelving. The kitchen and dining room lie downstairs. Neat white units dominate the kitchen, which has a large central island topped with marble and with a deep butler’s sink. A walk-in pantry provides plenty of space for spices and other dried goods, while a utility room at the opposite end of the storey has room for white goods. The second half of the room is arranged as a dining room and has glazed doors directly to steps that ascend to the enchanting rear garden. Twisting through the core of the house, the original staircase extends from the entrance hallway. Its white-painted treads are dressed with a sisal runner and a patinated handrail curves on the ascent. A sash window part of the way up draws in plenty of natural light. The house has three bedrooms, all appointed with soothingly neutral hues. The largest bedroom is at the front of the first floor and has tall built-in cupboards; the second bedroom, at the rear, has the same astonishing curved window as the reception below, with a romantic window seat beneath. Both are grounded with the same original floorboards as downstairs and are served by a smart shower room. A second set of stairs reached to the attic level, where a third bedroom has been tucked beneath the embracing slopes of the roofline. A window here provides far-reaching views across Islington’s patchwork of period architecture. The second half of the top floor is dedicated to an indulgent bathroom, with green-painted panelling and a cast-iron roll-top bath atop large-format ceramic tiles. The Great Outdoors A large garden unfurls behind the house, reached via steps from the lower-ground-floor kitchen or via a glazed door in the entrance corridor. Mature bushes run along its periphery, lending the space an enhanced feel of tranquility and a secret garden-like feel. This is amplified by the secret pockets and nooks its winding paved paths reveal, where pockets perfect for an outdoor dining set-up are nestled. Plants have taken root in a series of beds along the perimeters, including pops of pink roses. It is from the garden that the house’s singular architectural profile, with its curves and contours, can be admired in all its fullness. Out and About St Peter’s Street is a broad, peaceful residential street between Islington’s Upper Street and the Regent’s Canal. Close by are the likes of  Pophams Bakery , The Duke of Cambridge, Toconoco and  Towpath . Neighbourhood favourite, The Baring, is also within walking distance and serves delicious seasonal food. Islington’s Upper Street has an abundance of amenities, from Ottolenghi to Gail’s, the Almeida Theatre to The Old Red Lion Theatre & Pub. The charming Compton Arms and the wonderful Union Chapel are nearby, along with the Pig and Butcher. For art, the  Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art  is only a short walk away.  For green space, the broad expanses of Shoreditch Park lie less than 10 minutes’ walk away, while London Fields can be accessed via a delightful canal-side walk in the warmer months. There are plenty of schools nearby, including City of London Academy Islington and North Bridge House Senior Canonbury.

Designed by Richard Salt Architects, the building is characterised by striking glazed panels, a gently curved roof and hardwood window frames in a deep mahogany hue. This split-level house is masterfully arranged for modern living and has a tranquil tiered garden at the rear of the plan. Wonderfully located close to the shops and restaurants of Upper Street, the house is just a few minutes’ walk from Highbury and Islington Underground station.
 
 
 
 The Tour
 
 
 
 Entry to this remarkable house is via a smart wood-panelled door set into an exterior brick wall on the street. From outside, an elegantly curved roof and patterned glazing are visible, framed by mature trees and lush greenery and with the Union Chapel church in the background.
 
 
 
 Entry is to a bright vestibule, where two large skylights overhead allow light to pour into the space. A large interior window with two smaller French windows underneath provides a first glimpse of the kitchen beyond.
 
 
 
 A second door, cut into the exposed brickwork, opens onto a landing with sweeping views of the interiors, which have been cleverly arranged over two levels.
 
 
 
 From here, two short flights of steps with glazed balustrades descend to an expansive open-plan living area, which melds seamlessly into the kitchen. Engineered walnut floorboards run underfoot, and a bifold door stretches across a wall to allow an abundance of natural light to spill into the room, as well providing access to an outdoor courtyard.

Fitted cabinetry in a sleek grey tone extends vertically up one wall, with built-in appliances including a double oven.

There is fitted storage here housing utilities, and a walnut veneered desk stretches across the wall. A WC is also found on the ground floor.
 
 
 
 A floating staircase ascends from the ground floor landing to the first floor gallery. A gently curved glass panel stretches the width of the opposite wall, bathing the space in light while capturing treetop views; fully bespoke, the glazing was expertly designed by the architect of the home.
 
 
 
 There are two double bedrooms on this floor, both with gently curved ceilings, bespoke fitted storage and hardwood framed windows. Both bedrooms have en suite bathrooms with showers.

Brick walls bordered by lush greenery wrap around the garden, creating a sense of privacy and remove.

Situated on a quiet residential road, the property is very private and filled with natural light. Both are achieved through a collection of skylights, large, glazed doors and perforated brick openings. The ground floor along with two courtyards, mostly hidden from the street, occupies the whole site, while the facade of the top floor, visible from the street, relates directly to its neighbours. Enclosed on three sides, Aperture House fits quietly within the Victorian streetscape. Unashamedly modern, the house sits low and is sensitive to its surroundings. The interiors are tranquil, with the use of polished concrete, oak timber and carefully placed planters; there’s a tactile quality that brings a sense of grounding to the house. It’s a home that burrows down and feels protective yet expansive inside. The predominant yellow London stock of the surrounding houses inspired the choice of brick. It also inspired the decision to use a brick bond that resembles the Flemish bond used on the older houses, the formation of which allows for perforations within the layered façade to be formed. It creates a screen of privacy during the day, until night falls when, backlit, the elevation comes alive with interesting glowing patterns. Access is through the front gated entrance, behind which is a small, stepped courtyard. A second large courtyard sits on the opposite corner of the open plan living area. The courtyards are enclosed with full height glazed doors and windows. Combined with large rooflights to the kitchen and stairwell, the living spaces are filled with daylight while creating a route for passive stack ventilation through the house. Located between Essex Road and the charming, village-like streets of De Beauvoir, this sought-after pocket of North London offers urban convenience and community feel.

Accessed via its own private entrance, the home has two well-proportioned double bedrooms and the rare advantage of direct access to a secluded private garden.
 
 The entrance has beautifully laid Buff York stone paving and a meticulously repointed façade, finished in traditional lime mortar. The first floor is anchored by a beautifully proportioned reception room, where two generous sash windows draw in natural light and walls painted in Farrow & Ball's Joa's White. Oak parquet herringbone flooring runs underfoot, complemented by classic column radiators and centre piece marble fireplace that nod to the home's Victorian origins.
 
 At the rear, the open-plan kitchen has a Belfast sink and deep-navy blue shaker cabinetry, contrasted by light quartz worktops. A timber-topped island provides a warm, tactile counterpoint and a natural gathering point within the space.

Light filters in through a series of original side-by-side sash windows, each elegantly framed by softly arched reveals. These subtle architectural details quietly underscore the home's heritage. From the hallway, an iron staircase leads down into the west-facing, landscaped garden. Sheltered from neighbouring homes, this private retreat is ideal for morning coffee or a sundowner.

It's also incredibly comfortable, whether you're hosting friends for a lively evening or enjoying a cosy night in. Having a concierge on-site adds an extra layer of convenience that I've really appreciated. The building is home to a wide range of people including young families and working professionals. We’ve grown very close with several neighbors and always look forward to seeing their friendly faces in the lift or the nearby park. The building is well managed and the board is owner-run, which means service costs are carefully managed and aligned with owners’ incentives. WHY I'M SELLING. After nearly 6 wonderful years here, we’re moving to a new home where we can expand our family. We’re sad to leave this place, but won’t be moving far away. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE AREA. The location couldn't be better. Shoreditch Park is just steps away, offering a lovely spot to unwind in green surroundings and where we spend a lot of time with our small dog. The local cafes are a dream—Bobo & Wild, Towpath Cafe, and De Beauvoir Deli are some of our favorites. The nearby canal is perfect for weekend strolls, taking you through Islington, Broadway Market, and even all the way to Victoria Park. If you're into pubs and bars, there are some amazing spots nearby, like The Rosemary Branch (our local), Hector's, and the De Bauvoir Arms. Plus, you're perfectly positioned between some of London's best areas—Islington, Hoxton, Shoreditch, and Old Street are all within easy reach.

 More properties from this agent",[],"This bright two-bedroom live/work apartment lies in the heart of Shoreditch, moments from the greenery of Hoxton Square Park. Modern additions have been integrated amid a wealth of original features, including exposed brickwork and plenty of black-framed Crittall windows. Some of east London's best-loved restaurants are nearby, and Old Street Underground station is just six minutes away on foot. Liverpool Street and the City are also a short walk away.
 
 The Tour
 
 The building, once a hospital, is a handsome red-brick structure, half of which has been painted white. Original Crittall windows punctuate the frontage, hinting at the brightness within.
 
 This apartment lies on the third floor, accessed by stairs. Its front door opens to an entrance hall with a cupboard for coats and shoes. This gives way to an open-plan living space with soaring ceilings and exposed brick and white-washed walls. Original floorboards run underfoot, and light floods in through Crittall windows along two aspects. There are also double doors bounded by a Juliet balcony that, when left open, amplify its airy feel.
 
 Spaces for dining, cooking and relaxing are kept in constant dialogue by a lack of delineation. Black kitchen units run along one side, with plenty of space provided by a stainless-steel countertop. The remainder of the room is flexible and would suit various configurations.
 
 The principal bedroom is to the left of the entrance hall. Crittall windows draw in more light here, while built-in timber wardrobes offer plenty of storage space. The second bedroom – currently used as an office – sits adjacent to the living space. An exposed brick chimney breast nods to the building's early form.
 
 The bathroom is accessed from the living space. Exposed brickwork is a ruddy counterpoint to white wall tiles and black-painted floors.
 
 The Area
 
 Hoxton Square was an early example of London’s garden squares. Completed in 1720 and designed to emulate existing squares in the west of London, it was the first of its type in the area. In the 19th century, the square and surrounding streets became the centre of Shoreditch’s furniture and carpentry trade. Today, Hoxton is renowned for its exciting mix of restaurants, bars and galleries, including Rochelle Canteen, Shoreditch House, the Blue Mountain School and Victoria Miro. The boutiques and cafés of Redchurch Street and Spitalfields are also nearby.
 
 Hoxton Square Park, with its famous Stik sculpture, is just a minute’s walk from the apartment. The green expanses of London Fields, Victoria Park and Clissold Park are also easily accessible via the many bus routes in the area.
 
 For rail travel, Hoxton Station provides quick access to London Overground services; Liverpool Street Station runs the Central, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, as well as nationwide National Rail services. Old Street Underground station is a six-minute walk away, running Northern Line services across the city.

Owners insights: What do you love most about your home? The incredible natural light that fills every room, thanks to its rare triple aspect layout. Waking up in the east-facing bedrooms lit by morning sun is a delight, while the south-facing living area and spacious private terrace are bathed in sunlight throughout the day, perfect for relaxing or entertaining. As the day winds down, sunset lights pour through the west-facing windows, often giving the apartment a golden glow.

The home also features high-spec finishes and smart tech throughout, adding both comfort and convenience to everyday living. It’s a unique blend of light, space, and modern luxury that’s been a joy to call home. An added bonus is the communal roof terrace, perfect for uninterrupted views of London and drinks with friends or neighbours.  Why are you selling? It's a hard home to leave, however we are moving out of central London for our next chapter in a house closer to family. It’s been a wonderful home and we'll truly miss the light, space, and peaceful atmosphere. What do you love about the area? The perfect balance it strikes between charm, convenience, and community. We’re tucked away on a quiet road in the lovely De Beauvoir/Southgate Road pocket, close enough to the buzz of Dalston, Angel, and Shoreditch, but with a real sense of calm and neighbourhood feel. Shoreditch Park and Rosemary Gardens are both next door, and we’ve loved having Regent’s Canal on our doorstep for walks, runs, and cycles. There’s a great mix of leisure options nearby, from the newly redeveloped Britannia Leisure Centre with pools and sports pitches, to a great selection of yoga studios, CrossFit gyms, and more. And the local food and drink scene is genuinely amazing. We love grabbing pizza at Sweet Thursday, dinner at the cosy De Beauvoir Arms, or taking our friends for brunch and coffee at Bobo & Wild. One of our favourite weekend rituals is a sunset drink at the historic Rosemary Branch pub, just around the corner. But honestly, the heart of this place is the community. Our neighbours are mostly young professionals in their 30s and 40s, (and owner occupiers), and it really shows in how peaceful, respectful, and incredibly friendly everyone is. We’ve built some amazing friendships over the past four years, and people really do love living here. There’s a shared sense that this is somewhere to put down roots, not just pass through.

Being right by the canal means lovely walks to Camden and beyond, and we’re just a stone’s throw from the vibrant Granary Square and Coal Drops Yard. There’s a Waitrose within walking distance for daily needs, and when it’s time to unwind, The Star of Kings pub—with its buzzing summer terrace—is just around the corner. Superwan Thai on Caledonian Road is a hidden gem—easily one of the best Thai spots in London. EPC Rating: C
